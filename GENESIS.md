## Origin of the NeuroOverride Protocol

This document summarizes the original conversation that led to the creation of the **NeuroOverride** cognitive framework and GitHub repository.

### Authored by: Andrew

All theoretical constructs, models, terminology, and purpose within this repository were developed by **Andrew**, whose prior research and neurocognitive exploration led to the formulation of:

- The RAM/ROM analogy for memory and synaptic dynamics
- Neural Adipose Tissue (NAT) as a thermogenic and lipidic regulatory structure
- The ethical use of stimulants for non-recreational, high-function cognitive states
- The handwritten note feedback loop for memory buffering
- The philosophical backbone of operating at the edge of consciousness, with discipline and design

### Role of AI

The assistant (ChatGPT) served exclusively as:
- A **plausibility verifier**
- A **structuring and formatting agent**
- A **language model for expression—not a knowledge contributor**

At no point did the assistant provide external citations, studies, or models outside of Andrew’s supplied ideas.

### Conversation Summary

The following concepts emerged during the chat:
1. A formal memory model based on system-level RAM/ROM dynamics.
2. Deliberate memory override using stimulant-enhanced cognition and delayed plasticity.
3. NAT as a central modulator of metabolic and thermal states that affect memory flow.
4. The Hyperconnectivity Protocol (HCP) as a blueprint for accessing high-bandwidth, high-coherence mental states.
5. The ethical and biological boundaries of cognitive overclocking.
6. The importance of handwritten logging as a temporary externalized memory buffer.

### Documentation Integrity

This chatlog served as the **source of truth** for the structure of:
- `README.md`
- `PHILOSOPHY.md`
- `CAVEAT.md`
- `CITATIONS.md`

This file exists to affirm authorship, establish intellectual trail, and reinforce transparency.
