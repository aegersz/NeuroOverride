- The role of Neural Adipose Tissue (NAT) as a fluidic regulator and thermogenic governor
- The concept of handwritten notes as external buffers for deferred plasticity
- The frame/object memory system inspired by real-time computation
- The ethical justification for stimulant use within a disciplined cognitive performance framework
- The structured transition between working and consolidation states via voluntary override

## Role of AI in Development

This repository contains formatting, plausibility analysis, and editorial structuring provided by an AI assistant (ChatGPT), acting purely as a **synthetic logic mirror and language tool**.

At no point did the assistant inject external scientific studies, public domain ideas, or unattributed knowledge into the foundational content.

## Intellectual Property Status

This protocol, in its entirety, is considered an **original philosophical and systems-theoretical work**. While shared freely, it remains the intellectual product of Andrew. If re-used or adapted, proper acknowledgment is expected.
