## ⚠️ The Paradox of Unlimited Methamphetamine Use  

At first, methamphetamine feels like a **limitless key**:  
- 🧠 **Sharper thinking**  
- ⚡ **Endless energy**  
- ⏱️ **Time distortion advantage**  
- 💬 **Verbal fluency**  
- ✨ **Emotional detachment (control)**  

But **without boundaries**, it turns on you.  
What once **amplified** now **corrupts**:

- 🧠 ➝ **Cognition collapses** (looping thoughts, poor judgment)  
- ⚡ ➝ **Energy burns out** (exhaustion becomes baseline)  
- ⏱️ ➝ **Time disappears** (days vanish, nights blur)  
- 💬 ➝ **Speech fractures** (rants, tangents, paranoia)  
- ✨ ➝ **Emotionless becomes soulless** (no joy, no spark)

> "You become a slave to the thing that once made you a god."

That’s the **paradox**:  
The more you take to feel **in control**, the more you **lose control**.

Tapering is the antidote.  
NeuroOverride is the response.

**🧬 Use the chemical. Don’t let it use you.**
