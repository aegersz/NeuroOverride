**Part of the NeuroOverride Project by Andrew Egerszegi**

## PRIMARY STACK (DAILY USE)

| Compound          | Dose           | Purpose |
|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **NAC**          | 1000–2000 mg   | Glutathione precursor. Reduces oxidative stress & neurotoxicity. |
| **ALCAR**        | 500–1000 mg    | Mitochondrial support. Boosts alertness, memory, and fat metabolism. |
| **Resveratrol**  | 100–250 mg     | Antioxidant. Protects against neuroinflammation. Synergistic with MA. |
| **Benfotiamine** | 150–300 mg     | B1 derivative. Prevents cognitive decline, supports nerve health. |
| **PQQ**          | 10–40 mg       | Mitochondrial biogenesis. Works well with ALCAR. Neuroprotection. |
| **CDP-Choline**  | 250–500 mg     | Dopaminergic repair. Enhances memory and focus. Fights MA-induced depletion. |
| **L-Tyrosine**   | 500–2000 mg    | Dopamine precursor. Helps balance mood and focus. |
| **DLPA**         | 500–1500 mg    | Boosts endorphins and dopamine. Smooths emotional turbulence. |
| **Dopa Mucuna**  | 100–300 mg L-Dopa | Direct dopamine precursor. Use cautiously. Good on low MA days. |
| **B-Complex**    | 1 cap/day      | Cofactors for neurotransmitter synthesis. Mood and energy support. |
| **Vitamin C**    | 1000 mg        | General antioxidant. Also helps metabolize residual amphetamines. |
| **Magnesium**    | 200–400 mg     | Muscle/nerve function. Counters MA-induced tension and neurotoxicity. |
| **Potassium**    | 300–600 mg     | Electrolyte balance. Helps with hydration + nerve signalling. |
| **Omega 3-6-9**  | 1–3 g          | Anti-inflammatory. Neuroprotection and mood balance. |
| **Metoprolol**   | 25–50 mg       | Beta blocker. Cardiac stress control during taper or high-use days. |

## SECONDARY / ROTATIONAL

| Compound           | Frequency     | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| **5-HTP**         | 50–100 mg, alternate days | Serotonin precursor. Use only when mood drops. Avoid overuse. |
| **Ashwagandha**   | 300–600 mg    | Adaptogen. Cortisol regulation, stress reduction. Use in PM. |
| **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)** | 300–600 mg | Antioxidant. Supports nerve health, blood sugar, liver. |
| **Choline Bitartrate** | 250–500 mg | Backup choline source. Used when CDP is cycled off. |
| **Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA)** | 400–800 mg | Anti-inflammatory, may improve mood and focus. Synergistic with MA. |

## HYDRATION + DIET PROTOCOL

- **Water:** 2.5~5 L/day minimum  
- **Salt:** Small pinch of Himalayan salt or electrolyte mix in every second glass  
- **Caffeine:** Minimal. Only use if MA dose is low and fatigue sets in.  
- **Protein:** Prioritise eggs, nuts, lean meats — dopamine synthesis depends on it.  
- **Avoid:** Sugar, alcohol, high-histamine foods (can spike stress response)

---

## NOTES

- This stack is for **support**, not stimulation.  
- Pulse supplements if tolerance develops — especially Tyrosine, DLPA, 5-HTP.  
- Never mix MA + Dopa Mucuna + high-dose CDP without spacing — avoid dopamine overload.  
- Always listen to your sleep, hydration, and digestion — they're early warning systems.

**This is your shield. Keep it sharp.**  
From peak to precision, the NeuroOverride stack evolves with the taper.
