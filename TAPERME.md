### Methamphetamine Taper Log & Cognitive Recovery Protocol  
**Part of the NeuroOverride Report by Andrew Egerszegi**

---

## WHY THIS EXISTS  
Once, I took **2500–3000 mg** of meth in a single day.  
That wasn’t a party. That was chemistry gone feral.  
This log is not about shame.  
It’s about **control, data, and clawing your mind back**.

I taper, I track, I think clearly now.  
This is not advice. This is **testimony**.

## TAPER TIMELINE  

| Phase           | Approx. Daily Dose | Notes |
|----------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Zero Point** | 2500–3000 mg (once)| Acute stimulant saturation. Total override. |
| **Initial Descent** | 1000–1200 mg     | Still functioning. Sleep disrupted. Stack began here. |
| **Stabilization Begins** | 850–900 mg  | Spaced mini-doses. Heavy hydration starts. |
| **Phase Control** | 700 mg           | Add NAC, CDP-Choline, DLPA, ALCAR. No comedown. |
| **Precision Phase** | 500 mg         | All cognitive systems green. |
| **Microdose Strategy** | 400 mg (Days 1–4) | Stable. Balanced. Hydrated to urgency. |
| **Transition Point** | 350 mg (Days 5–8) | Next drop scheduled. Function > reward. |
| **Final Target** | **125 mg/day (~$25)** | Sustainable endpoint. Will hold and evaluate. |

## NEUROCHEMICAL ARMOUR  

**Stack (Daily or Cycled):**  
- **Neuro-Repair:** NAC, ALA, Resveratrol, Benfotiamine, PQQ  
- **Cognition:** CDP-Choline, DLPA, Tyrosine, Dopa Mucuna, ALCAR  
- **Mood Balance:** 5-HTP (rotated), Ashwagandha, B-Complex  
- **System Support:** Omega 3-6-9, Metoprolol (50 mg for cardiac load), Magnesium, Potassium  
- **Hydration:** 3–5L/day (to urgency). Not negotiable.

## PURPOSE  

This is for anyone who’s ever whispered:  
**“This can’t be sustainable.”**  
You’re right. It’s not. But you **can** build a protocol that *buys you time*, *protects your brain*, and *keeps your systems clean*.  

Don’t go cold turkey. Don’t go blind. Go calculated.

No rehab. No slogans. No gatekeepers.  
Just logs, cognition, and NeuroOverride.  
Track it. Own it. Or it will own you.
